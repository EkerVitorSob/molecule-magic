## 🎯 Purpose

Molecule Magic addresses the challenge of limited access to chemistry laboratories in rural areas. By providing a virtual alternative, we ensure that all students can:
- Conduct chemistry experiments safely
- Visualize molecular interactions
- Understand chemical reactions at the atomic level
- Learn through interactive experiences
- Practice lab techniques without resource constraints

## ✨ Features

- **Virtual Laboratory Environment**: Safe space for chemical experiments
- **Interactive Element Selection**: Pick and combine different elements
- **Real-time Reaction Visualization**: See color changes and physical transformations
- **Atomic Level View**: Observe molecular interactions and bonding
- **Catalyst Demonstrations**: Understand reaction kinetics and catalytic processes
- **Grade-Specific Content**: Tailored experiments for grades 1-12
- **Safety First**: Built-in safety guidelines and precautions
- **Educational Resources**: Integrated learning materials and explanations
